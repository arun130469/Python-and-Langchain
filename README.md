# Setting Up and Using Jupyter Notebooks in GitHub Codespace

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and using Jupyter notebooks within a GitHub Codespace.

## 1. Open Your Codespace

- Start by creating or opening a Codespace from your GitHub repository.

## 2. Install Jupyter Notebook

If Jupyter is not already installed in your Codespace, you'll need to install it:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## 3. Create a New Jupyter Notebook
To create a new Jupyter notebook:
1. Open the command palette in CodeSpace by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS).
2. Type `Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook` and select it from the options.
3. Choose the kernel you want to use for the notebook (e.g., Python).
4. A new notebook will open, and you can start adding code cells.

## 4. Use an Existing Notebook

If you already have a `.ipynb` file in your repository:

- Open the file directly from the file explorer in Code by clicking on it.
- The notebook will open in the notebook editor, and you can start working with it.

## 5. Run the Jupyter Notebook

- To run cells within the notebook, click the "Run" button next to each cell or use the `Shift + Enter` shortcut to run the current cell and move to the next one.
- First time you will need to select kernal, your codespace might not have Kernal and the shortcut was to do that is adding follwing jupyter extension.
```
Name: Jupyter
Id: ms-toolsai.jupyter
Description: Jupyter notebook support, interactive programming and computing that supports Intellisense, debugging and more.
Version: 2024.7.0
Publisher: Microsoft
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter
```

## 6. Save and Commit Your Work

- Save your notebook regularly by pressing `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on macOS).
- To commit your changes to GitHub, use the standard Git commands in the terminal or the Source Control panel in Codespace.


## Summary

- **Install Jupyter Notebook** using `pip install notebook`.
- **Create a new Jupyter notebook** using the VS Code command palette.
- **Open and edit existing notebooks** directly from the file explorer.
- **Run your cells** directly in the notebook editor in the Codespace.
- **Save and commit** your work to your GitHub repository.

This setup allows you to work seamlessly with Jupyter notebooks within your Codespace environment.
